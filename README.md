# Algorithmic Truth Table Method (ATTM)

[ ... _**still under construction**_ ...]  

Files related to the use of an Algorithmic Truth Table Method (ATTM) for proving the validity/invalidity of certain argument forms (singly-quantified and monadic).  In particular, the ATTM can be used for evaluating the validity of each of the 256 possible forms of a categorical syllogism (CS).

The method was previously presented in the following scientific meetings:

* Second Lecture Series for SY 2003-2004 of the Mathematical Society of the Philippines â€“ National Capital Region Chapter (November 22, 2003). Seminar Room, Mapua Institute of Technology, Intramuros, Manila.
* 2003 Science and Technology Research Colloquium (November 19, 2003). Thomas Aquinas Research Complex, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines.
